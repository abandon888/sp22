Remember that objects must be defined in order for the documentation shortcut to work; for example, all of the documentation will show for method calls from `np` since we've already executed `import numpy as np`. However, since `z` is not yet defined in the kernel, `z.reshape(x.shape)` will not show documentation until you run the line `z = np.cos(squared)`.\n",
